## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Efficiently preprocess raw data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize customer data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations that illustrate customer segments.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
